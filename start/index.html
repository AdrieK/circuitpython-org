    <h2>Getting started with CircuitPython is fill in the blank</h2>
    <p>
      CircuitPython is a programming language designed to simplify experimenting
      and learning to program on low-cost microcontroller boards. It makes
      getting started easier than ever with no upfront desktop downloads needed.
      Once you get your board set up, open any text editor, and get started
      editing code. It's that simple.

              Some of the CircuitPython compatible boards come with CircuitPython
              installed. Others are CircuitPython-ready, but need to have it
              installed. As well, you may want to update the version of
              CircuitPython already installed on your board. The steps are the
              same for installing and updating.
